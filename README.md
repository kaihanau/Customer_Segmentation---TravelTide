# Customer_Segmentation---TravelTide
Customer segmentation for the purpose of marketing

TravelTide is facing challenges concerning customer retention. The management decided to implement customer rewards program to incentivize the customers to continuously use TravelTideâ€™s services.

We are tasked with coming up with segmentation of customers and with assigning perks based on that segmentation.

To conduct the analysis I employed the RFM method.

The RFM analysis considers three characteristics:

- Recency - how recent was the latest activity?Monetary - what was the total revenue?
- Frequency - how frequent were our products purchased?
- Monetary - what was the total revenue?

Each customer was given a score for each of the above characteristics - the higher the score, the better.Based on these scores they were then grouped into segments.Perks were then assigned to specific customers based on their segments as well as other individual characteristics (family status, age etc.)

Key insights:

- For the purpose of our analysis we considered the customers who accessed our website since 04.01.2023 no less than seven times.
- The number of our customers that met the above criteria was 5998.
- Based on that selected cohort we have created segmentation that consists of 6 distinct groups.
- We then assigned perks to specific customers based on their segments as well as several other individual characteristics (family status, age etc.)

Recommendations:

- It has to be stressed that our proposition need to be tested to see if perks are effective in achieving our goal. Once the test is concluded the collected data needs to be reviewed and fixes implemented.
- For future data collection purposes we recommend asking customers as they complete their bookings about purpose of the trip (business, leisure etc.) or who are they travelling with (family, friends). That would enable us to conduct more in depth analysis of customers behaviour and hopefully lead to more effective marketing campaigns.
- We have also discovered several issues in collected data and we will be forwarding those to data engineering team for them to be fixed.
